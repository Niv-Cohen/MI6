During System Programming I've been required to create an interface that simulate MI6 agent dispatch.
 That includes: 
Money Penny- She checks the availability of 00 agents 
Q- Responsible for the 00 weapons 
Intelligence- Receives secret missions 
M- Sheâ€™s the boss and responsible to acquire all that is needed for the mission.

Multi Thread implemantation is needed in this project in order to dispatch several missions on the same time, In addition to keeping track on the gadgets and agents.
